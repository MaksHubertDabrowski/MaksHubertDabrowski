### Hi, I'm Maks 👋

I am a 3rd-year Geoinformatics student at UMCS with a strong interest in GIS. 

Most of my focus right now is on spatial data processing and ETL workflows. I really enjoy working with **FME** to transform, clean, and structure raw spatial datasets into something more manageable and useful. 

I'm constantly learning and trying to improve my skills in data integration and geographic analysis. 

**Currently exploring:**
* Practical applications of FME for spatial data transformations.
* Improving my workflows for handling various GIS data formats.

Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about GIS, student projects, or spatial data processing!
